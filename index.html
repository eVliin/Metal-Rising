          <figure class="f2">
            <h3>Raiden</h3>
            <figcaption class="raidn">Raiden (雷電?), real name Jack, also known as Jack the Ripper, White Devil, and Snake, was a Liberian-American mercenary and former special forces soldier. Previously a child soldier under Solidus Snake, Raiden was later selected by the Patriots to test the S3 Plan at the Big Shell, as a new recruit to the reformed FOXHOUND unit. He later worked alongside the Paradise Lost Army in their anti-Patriot activities, but was captured and forced to undergo heavy cybernetic experimentation. After successfully escaping, Raiden went on to assist Solid Snake during the Guns of the Patriots Incident. <span>"I said my sword was a tool of justice. Not used in anger. Not used for vengeance. But now... Now I'm not so sure. And besides, this isn't my sword. [...] OK. Let's dance."

          <figure class="f3">
            <h3>Jetstream Sam</h3>
            <figcaption class="raidn">Samuel Rodrigues, also known as Jetstream Sam and Minuano (ミヌアノ?), was a cyborg mercenary involved with the Desperado PMC group who fought against Raiden during the events of 2018. He was a Brazilian master swordsman of the "Rodrigues New Shadow School" technique, which had derived from the "Yagyu Shinkage-ryu" (Yagyu New Shadow School) of Japan.<span> Rodrigues was descended from a long line of swordsmen, dating back to 16th century Japan. His father ran a Brazilian Kenjutsu dojo, and specifically taught the Uradachi technique, better known as Satsujin-ken or "the murdering sword," which dealt with violence as the end goal. Sam's father was eventually killed by one of his pupils, with one of the drug cartels being rumored to have been involved for reasons and methods unknown, although not before Sam personally inherited his Murasama blade from his father. He then left Brazil, presumably to train, and eventually returned to kill the pupil in question before leaving Brazil permanently.</span> </figcaption>

            <h3>Steven 'Senator' Armstrong</h3>

            <figcaption class="raidn">Steven Armstrong was a United States Senator representing the U.S. state of Colorado, as well as a candidate for the 2020 United States presidential election.[2] He was also the benefactor for World Marshal Inc., its de facto CEO, and its most powerful warrior. He was also allied with the Winds of Destruction of Desperado Enforcement LLC. <span>Steven Armstrong (スティーヴン・アームストロング Sutīvun Āmusutorongu?) is the main antagonist of Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance. He is voiced in the English version by Scottish actor Alastair Duncan, while his motion capture actor is Masahiro Nagai, who also performed the motion capture for Sundowner and Boris Vyacheslavovich Popov. Owing to the character's background, Duncan voiced the character with a Texan accent. While his first name is spelled as "Steven" in both the final version and the early promotional poster (partially obscured by the "Monger" graffiti),</span></figcaption>
